## Curriculum/content

The MVP curriculum foundation covers **Bihar Board / SCERT Class 6, 7 and 8 Maths + Science**.

Each subject has chapter-level mapping plus three published learning stages per chapter:

1. पहले समझें — foundation
2. उदाहरण से सीखें — guided practice
3. खुद करके पक्का करें — mastery

Each stage includes explanation/challenge/summary or help content and curriculum-linked practice questions. The learning content is authored for QuantaEdge; it is not a copy of the SCERT textbook text.

SCERT Bihar officially publishes the Class 6–8 textbooks and teacher handbooks used as the curriculum reference for this mapping. The repository keeps the curriculum reference separate from QuantaEdge-authored lesson content.

## Local preview student

Local Docker development seeds **exactly one** student when `APP_DEMO_SEED=true`:

- Name: आर्यन
- Class: 7
- Board: Bihar Board
- Environment: LOCAL_PREVIEW
- Progress: every published lesson completed
- Practice: every published question has a correct preview attempt

This is a controlled QA fixture, not production customer data. The production compose file explicitly sets `APP_DEMO_SEED=false`.

## One-command local run

Linux / macOS / Git Bash / WSL:

```bash
bash scripts/quantaedge-local.sh up
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\quantaedge-local.ps1 up
```

Useful actions:

```bash
bash scripts/quantaedge-local.sh rebuild
bash scripts/quantaedge-local.sh down
bash scripts/quantaedge-local.sh reset
bash scripts/quantaedge-local.sh logs
```

Use `reset` only when you intentionally want to remove the local PostgreSQL/Redis volumes and rebuild the preview database from migrations.

## Local runtime architecture

```text
Browser
  ↓
Next.js web/admin
  ↓  /api/* rewrite
Spring Boot API
  ↓
PostgreSQL + Redis
```

The browser does not need a hard-coded API host. Next.js proxies `/api/*` to the internal API service, which keeps local Docker and future production domains aligned.

## Production deployment shape

GitHub Actions builds immutable SHA-tagged images and publishes them to GHCR on `main`. The production compose file consumes those images.

The production compose configuration disables the local preview seed. No synthetic student is created there.

## Important market-readiness boundary

The current branch is a production-shaped MVP, but external launch dependencies still need real credentials/configuration before accepting customers: real parent/guardian verification, SMS/OTP delivery, legal/privacy contact configuration, AI provider credentials and operational monitoring. These must not be replaced with fake/demo values.

## CI

GitHub Actions validates the Spring Boot API and both Next.js applications, then builds Docker images. Main publishes the immutable SHA-tagged images to GHCR.
